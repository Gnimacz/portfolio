                            degrading. Luckily enough, a squirrel out of nowhere knocks on your front door announcing
                            that you have won a raffle with the prize of a bigger and better island! Grabbing your
                            tools, you set sail to begin your new life but only to find another critter has claimed the

                            bare empty island into a thriving home before winter arrives? It won't be easy but you will
                            have many friends to help out and work with you.

                    Lily's Island is a cute resource management game made for the minecraft bedrock edition marketplace
                    created by Humblebright Studios. I
                    worked on this map as the sole programmer. So I did project file management, coding, a little bit of
                    technical animation. For this project my general programming knowledge and thinking skills came in
                    handy. Since minecraft uses JSON for all of its modifications knowing that was also very helpful. As
                    the sole programmer I had to communicate with the artists on the team and make sure everything was
                    communicated correctly when I needed something changed or added.
                    The game itself consists of a big island that the player can upgrade to a home. The player can also
                    interact with the island and the critters that live on it. The island has 5 different branches to
                    upgrade. The players house, the mines, the fishing dock, the forest.
