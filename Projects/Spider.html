                            "Spider Collider" is a family-friendly physics-based puzzle game. Play as a spider as it
                            collects flies and avoids obstacles to get back to its mate at home.

                            The game allows the player to attach and detach themselves from connection points spread
                            throughout the levels. With a limited amount of legs, the player has to be careful where
                            they swing and think strategically before they make a move.

                    Spider Collider gives the player three types of connections that may be be available throughout the
                    levels,
                    each with their own unique utility that allow the player to overcome obstacles if used correctly.

                    This game was made in 2 weeks for a team project where the goal was to create a physics-based puzzle
                    game.
                    As one of the two engineers on the team my job was to create the physics engine and write collision
                    code for the game. This code was written in C# with the Saxion GXPEngine.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The game consists of 10 levels, with the beginning few serving the purpose of introducing the
                    connections to the player, one by one. As the player progresses further into the game, more
                    connections are used in conjunction with one another to create a bigger challenge.
