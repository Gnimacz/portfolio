                    Sweet Defense is a minecraft bedrock edition marketplace map created by Humblebright Studios. I
                    worked on this map as the sole programmer. So I did project file management, coding, a little bit of
                    technical animation. For this project my general programming knowledge and thinking skills came in
                    handy. Since minecraft uses JSON for all of its modifications knowing that was also very helpful. As
                    the sole programmer I had to communicate with the artists on the team and make sure everything was
                    communicated correctly when I needed something changed or added.
                    The game itself consists of 5 levels, each introducing a new unique type of enemy and ending the
                    level with a custom-written boss fight. The Map concludes by having the player pick between two
                    sides and having one final, epic boss fight.
